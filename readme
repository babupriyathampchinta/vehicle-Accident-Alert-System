The project “VEHICLE ACCIDENT ALERT SYSTEM” presents 

[1] Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers Using IR Glasses, Arduino, Buzzer Relay Module, etc. the design and implementation of a system aimed at preventing accidents caused by driver drowsiness. The proposed solution integrates infrared (IR) glasses to monitor the driver's eye movements, an Arduino microcontroller for processing data, and a buzzer relay module to provide auditory alerts. The IR glasses detect eyelid closures, signaling potential sleep episodes. These signals are sent to the Arduino, which analyzes the data in real-time. Upon detecting prolonged eye closure, the system triggers the buzzer relay module, emitting a loud sound to wake the driver and if the driver still closes his eyes, then based on the code given to Arduino the vehicle will stop.

[2] An "Accident Detection and Reporting System" utilizing deep learning techniques. Central to this system is the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, known for its robustness in image processing tasks. The system processes real-time video feeds from dashboard cameras, using the VGG16 model to detect accidents with high accuracy. The model, pre-trained on a large dataset and further fine-tuned for the specific task of accident detection, serves as the core of the detection mechanism. The process involves several stages: image preprocessing to enhance the quality of video frames, feature extraction to identify critical elements within the frames, and classification to determine whether an accident has occurred.

Upon detecting an accident, the system employs an automated reporting protocol using Twilio software. This protocol promptly sends crucial information such as the accident’s location, time, and severity to emergency services, ensuring a rapid response. The integration of these components ensures that the system is not only capable of detecting accidents accurately but also of facilitating immediate emergency response, which is critical for improving outcomes in traffic incidents.
